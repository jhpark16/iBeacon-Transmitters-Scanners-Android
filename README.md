## iBeacon Transmitters and Scanners for iOS

iBeacon is Apple's Bluetooth low-energy wireless technology to provide location based information and services. It is similar to AltBeacon and Google's Eddystone. All these beacons are transmitters and use the same BLE advertising packet transmission technologies. The packet can deliver up to 37 bytes of data per transmission.
